The goal of this book is to offer such an opportunity, by way of a visit to the p-adic universe. Such a visit offers a glimpse of a part of mathematics which is both important and fun, and which also is something of a meeting point between algebra and analysis. Over the last century, p-adic numbers and p-adic analysis have come to playa central role in modern number theory. This importance comes from the fact that they afford a natural and powerful language for talking about congruences between integers, and allow the use of methods borrowed from calculus and analysis for studying such problems. More recently, p-adic num­ bers have shown up in other areas of mathematics, and even in physics.},

This gives some perspective on the scope and limitations of one of the most powerful techniques commonly used in control theory. Also before having much hope of representing engineering problems as LMIs by automatic methods one needs a good idea of which problems can and cannot be represented by LMIs. Little is currently known about such problems. In this article we give a necessary condition, we call "rigid convexity", which must hold for a set \$\{{\textbackslash}cC\} {\textbackslash}in \{{\textbackslash}mathbb R\}{\textasciicircum}m\$ in order for \$\{{\textbackslash}cC\}\$ to have an LMI representation. Rigid convexity is proved to be necessary and sufficient when \$m=2\$. This settles a question formally stated by Pablo Parrilo and Berndt Sturmfels in [PSprep].},

Semidefinite programming is an important numerical tool for analysis and synthesis in systems and control theory. It has also been recognized in combinatorial optimization as a valuable technique for obtaining bounds on the solution of NP-hard problems.2.(2) The problem of maximizing the determinant of a positive definite matrix subject to linear matrix inequalities. This problem has applications in computational geometry, experiment design, information and communication theory, and other fields. We review some of these applications, including some interesting applications that are less well known and arise in statistics, optimal experiment design and VLSI.},

The contributions of this paper are: (i) For bounded SDP representable sets \$W\_1,...,W\_m\$, we give an explicit construction of an SDP representation for \${\textbackslash}cv\{{\textbackslash}cup\_\{k=1\}{\textasciicircum}mW\_k\}\$. This provides a technique for building global SDP representations from the local ones. (ii) For the SDP representability of a compact convex semialgebraic set \$S\$, we prove sufficient condition: the boundary \${\textbackslash}bdS\$ is positively curved, and necessary condition: \${\textbackslash}bdS\$ has nonnegative curvature at smooth points and on nondegenerate corners. This amounts to the strict versus nonstrict quasi-concavity of defining polynomials on those points on \${\textbackslash}bdS\$ where they vanish. The gaps between them are \${\textbackslash}bdS\$ having positive versus nonnegative curvature and smooth versus nonsmooth points. A sufficient condition bypassing the gaps is when some defining polynomials of \$S\$ are sos-concave. (iii) For the SDP representability of the convex hull of a compact nonconvex semialgebraic set \$T\$, we find that the critical object is \${\textbackslash}pt\_cT\$, the maximum subset of \${\textbackslash}pt T\$ contained in \${\textbackslash}pt {\textbackslash}cv\{T\}\$. We prove sufficient conditions for SDP representability: \${\textbackslash}pt\_cT\$ is positively curved, and necessary conditions: \${\textbackslash}pt\_cT\$ has nonnegative curvature at smooth points and on nondegenerate corners. The gaps between them are similar to case (ii). The positive definite Lagrange Hessian (PDLH) condition is also discussed.},

	abstract = {The Semistable Reduction Theorem by Deligne and Mumford states that any absolutely irreducible smooth projective curve over a field with a discrete valuation has a semistable model, at least if one admits a finite separable extension of the base field. The original proof does not provide a construction which can in practice be exploited to compute semistable models of curves. A recent proof of the Semistable Reduction Theorem by Arzdorf and Wewers uses techniques which are more accessible to algorithmic constructions. The present work makes several aspects of their approach explicit and realizes them in a computer algebra system. We represent models as finite sets of discrete valuations which correspond to the irreducible components of the special fiber. A theory by Mac Lane provides a compact representation of such valuations which is well suited for algorithmic considerations. In particular, it allows us to efficiently compute the normalization of a model of X in Y, i.e., the valuations which correspond to the normalization. From this we can also immediately deduce whether a model has reduced special fiber or not, a necessary condition for a model to be semistable. If the special fiber of a model is not reduced, then a theorem of Epp guarantees that there is a finite extension of the base field which makes it reduced. As Epp"s method is not fully constructive, we discuss alternatives to his approach. Using the theory of Mac Lane valuations, we provide a new algorithm to construct such an extension of the base field when working in mixed characteristic (0,p). Our algorithm is provably correct if p does only divide the degree of the cover of Y over X once. Assuming that the special fiber is reduced, we provide a new algorithm to compute equations for certain affine patches of the special fiber. Finally, we illustrate all the techniques developed in this work by computing semistable models in several examples.},
