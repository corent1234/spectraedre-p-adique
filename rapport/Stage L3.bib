We also show that these inequalities become equalities under genericity conditions, and that the leading coefficients of the eigenvalues are determined as the eigenvalues of auxiliary matrix polynomials.},

We provide an explicit polyhedral characterization of generic tropical spectrahedra, involving principal tropical minors of size at most 2. One of the key ingredients is Denef-Pas quantifier elimination result over valued fields. We obtain from this that the nonarchimedean valuation maps semialgebraic sets to semilinear sets that are closed. We also prove that, under a regularity assumption, the image by the valuation of a basic semialgebraic set is obtained by tropicalizing the inequalities which define it.},

The goal of this book is to offer such an opportunity, by way of a visit to the p-adic universe. Such a visit offers a glimpse of a part of mathematics which is both important and fun, and which also is something of a meeting point between algebra and analysis. Over the last century, p-adic numbers and p-adic analysis have come to playa central role in modern number theory. This importance comes from the fact that they afford a natural and powerful language for talking about congruences between integers, and allow the use of methods borrowed from calculus and analysis for studying such problems. More recently, p-adic num­ bers have shown up in other areas of mathematics, and even in physics.},
